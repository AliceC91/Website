<h1>Our Story...</h1>
<p>Established in 2000, Pikachi, the founder and master of several martial arts including judo, aikido, karate and ninja, was created when a bright spark awoken a sense of teaching in him.</p>
<p>His love for mentoring his fellow classmates and explaining difficult concepts encouraged him to start coaching a small class of 3 willing students in his back garden. It was this love that planted the seed of the dojo, but his passion of teaching that made him continue.</p>
<p>The look in his studentâ€™s eyes told him exactly why he should continue to expand his work. Today, standing at five stories tall, his very own dojo with his three original students as masters, his kingdom grew into a community of pride and dedication where students encourage each other. </a></p>
<p>We hope you can join our family too, do not hesitate to contact us to experience life in the dojo before you decide to commit. </p>
